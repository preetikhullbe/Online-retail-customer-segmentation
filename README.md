# Online Retail Customer Segmentation


Welcome to the Online Retail Customer Segmentation project! This repository contains the code and resources for segmenting customers in the online retail industry. The objective of this project is to analyze customer behavior and group them into distinct segments based on their purchasing patterns, demographics, and other relevant factors.

Customer segmentation is a powerful technique that helps businesses understand their customer base better and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly. By identifying different customer segments, businesses can create personalized offers, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize their marketing campaigns.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will work with a real-world dataset from an online retail company. The dataset contains information on customer transactions, including details such as product descriptions, quantities purchased, prices, and customer IDs. We will perform exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and apply clustering algorithms to segment the customers effectively.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`data`**: This directory contains the dataset used for analysis and segmentation. It includes customer transaction records and related information.

- **`notebooks`**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step instructions and code for data analysis, preprocessing, and customer segmentation.

- **`src`**: This directory contains the source code for clustering algorithms and any additional utility functions.

- **`results`**: This directory will store the segmentation results, such as cluster assignments and visualizations.

- **`requirements.txt`**: This file lists the dependencies required to run the code in this repository.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:


1. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory. They are numbered in the order they should be executed.

2. Run the code and experiment with different clustering algorithms, preprocessing techniques, and feature engineering approaches.
